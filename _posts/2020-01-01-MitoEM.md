The goal is to segment and identify automatically mitochondria instances in EM images. To solve such task pairs of EM images and their corresponding instance segmentation labels are provided. Below a pair example is depicted:

MitoEM dataset is composed by two EM volumes from human and rat cortices, named MitoEM-H and MitoEM-R respectively. Each 
volume has a size of ``(1000,4096,4096)`` voxels, for ``(z,x,y)`` axes. Both tissues contain multiple instances
entangling with each other with unclear boundaries and complex morphology, e.g., (a) mitochondria-on-a-string (MOAS)
instances are connected by thin microtubules, and (b) multiple instances can entangle with each other.
